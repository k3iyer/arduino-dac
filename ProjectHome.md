This project's main purpose is for the data acquisition of lithium ion batteries.

The PC side is written using Java/Processing.org.
Each PC is connected to 10 arduinos.  Each arduino has two purposes.  For one, it is a PID controller to control the temperature of the batteries under test. Secondly, it is a data acquisition system which polls information off the sensors to determine the kw/h's used during each test.


This is a work in progress.
