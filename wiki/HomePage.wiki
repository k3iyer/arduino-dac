=Welcome to the Battery Cycler Wiki=

= Introduction =

This is where you can find documentation on the use and inner workings of the open hardware/software battery cycler project.

==What does it do?== 

The battery cycler charges and discharges a lithium ion battery and measures how the capacity of the battery changes over time.

==Why would you do that?==

In plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, the battery is charged and discharged more often and more deeply than an electric vehicle. As a result, the battery in a PHEV may wear out quickly.  Understanding how the rate of charge/discharge affects battery wearout will help guide future battery chemistries, power conversion equipment, and controls.

= Details =

Right now all the design documentation is stored in a repository (svn). 
* The user manual R2 is a good but detailed description of what the system does
